# BoonStacker

Hades II mod that modifies the boon selection system to allow stacking boons on core slots (Attack, Special, Cast, Sprint, Magick) instead of replacing them.

## Features

-   **Boon Stacking**: Core slot boons (e.g., Aphrodite Attack + Zeus Attack) can now coexist.
-   **No Replacements**: "Swap" or "Replace" offers are disabled for these slots, ensuring you simply add to your arsenal.

## Install

Use a mod manager like r2modman or Thunderstore Mod Manager to install.

## Manual Install

1.  Ensure you have [Hell2Modding](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/Hell2Modding/Hell2Modding/) installed.
2.  Extract the `BoonStacker` folder into your `Hades II/Content/Mods` directory (or follow the instructions for your specific mod loader).
